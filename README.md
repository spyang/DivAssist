## Introduction
Resize DIV dimensions easily.

DivAssist is designed to solve a common problem with DIVs where you want
the dimensions of your DIVs to fill up the available space on a page and
also handle resizing of the web browser's dimensions.  In the past,
the standard approach was to use FRAMESET tags, which automatically handled
the case when a browser was resized.  Unfortunately, DIV tags do not
automatically resize by default.  DivAssist solves this problem,
allowing DIVs to behave more like FRAMESETs.

## How to Use
See the samples directory for examples of DivAssist in action.  It takes
very few lines of code to make use of DivAssist.  One prerequisite is jQuery.
Although I have a version of jQuery checked into this repository, any
remotely recent version of jQuery should work just fine.

## More About DivAssist
I created this project not only because I consider DivAssist to be useful, but
also because I've never open sourced anything and figured this would be
a nice way to get some experience.
